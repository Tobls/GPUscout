# GPUscout

A tool for discovering data movement-related bottlenecks on NVidia GPUs.

## Description

//TODO


## Installation

GPUscout can be installed with cmake; spack package is coming in the near future.

//TODO

For this project, [Nvidia CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [HPCToolkit](http://hpctoolkit.org/) need to be installed. With the installation of the CUDA Toolkit, [Nvidia Nsight Compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute) should also be automatically installed.
`CUPTI` and `libpcsampling` needs to be added to the respective `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`s.

Note that this tool has been tested with CUDA 11.6 and 11.8 on NVIDIA Volta and Turing architectures.


## Usage
Create a subdirectory named `executable` inside the tool parent directory. 

Generate two executables using the `nvcc` compiler:
- Executable generated by normal compilation, say `<executable_name>`.
- Executable generated by using the `-cubin` flag with the `nvcc` compiler. The name of this executable should be prefixed with `cubin-`, i.e. `cubin-<executable_name>`.

Copy both the above generated executables in the `executable` subdirectory.

To start using this tool, add the name of your executable in the `setup.sh` file as `file_name=<executable_name>`. Run the `setup.sh` script as `./setup.sh`.

This should automatically start analysing the code and printing recommendations on the terminal screen.

For older NVIDIA architectures (like Pascal), a dry run option has been provided that reports based on SASS instructions only. This can be 
run as `setup.sh --dry_run`.
